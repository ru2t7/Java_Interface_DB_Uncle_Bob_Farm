# Java_Interface_DB_Uncle_Bob_Farm

Second Year Java Interface Project for a DBeaver PostgreSQL Data Base.
The documentation "Uncle Bob's Farm" explains more about how the interface looks and how the project is structured.
Used the Model-View-Controller OOP structure, the repository package makes the connection with the database.
I provided also a sql dump script for the creation of the database.
